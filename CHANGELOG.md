- System now fetches sprints from all teams (16 teams, hundreds of sprints)
- Sprint queries work reliably for any team (Marketing, CX, Engineering, etc.)

---

## [0.1.2] - 2025-01-05

### 🔧 Fixed
- **CRITICAL: Multi-team sprint fetching** - Now fetches sprints from ALL teams, not just first team
  - Previous behavior: Only fetched sprints from first team ("Parks and Recreation")
  - New behavior: Fetches sprints from all 16 teams in parallel
  - Fixes "marketing sprint" queries that failed because Marketing Experience sprints weren't loaded
  - Deduplicates sprints by path (some teams share sprints)
  - Sorts by most recent first

### 🚀 Enhanced

  - Can correctly answer queries like "show me marketing sprint items"
  - Can find sprints for any team/area (CX, Marketing, Engineering, etc.)
  - Better sprint name matching across all teams

### 🛠️ Technical Details
- Modified `getSprints()` to fetch from all teams when no specific team requested
- Added `getSprintsForTeam()` helper method for per-team fetching
- Uses `Promise.allSettled()` for parallel fetching with error resilience
- Added `team` field to sprint objects for traceability

  - Better interpretation of casual queries (e.g., "what's broken?" → bugs)
  - Enhanced conversational responses with context and actionable insights
  - Improved error messages with specific guidance and suggestions
  - Added sprint context awareness (fetches available sprints to inform AI)

### 🚀 Added
- **Sprint query detection** - Automatically detects sprint-related queries
  - `isSprintQuery()` - Identifies queries about sprints/iterations
  - `buildSprintContext()` - Provides AI with actual sprint names and paths
  - `validateAndFixWiqlQuery()` - Safety net that auto-corrects invalid WIQL

### 🎯 Impact
- **Sprint queries now work reliably** - Users can ask about sprints naturally
- **Better user experience** - More helpful, context-aware responses
- **Fewer errors** - Automatic validation and correction of queries
- **100% backward compatible** - No breaking changes to existing features

### 🛠️ Technical Details
